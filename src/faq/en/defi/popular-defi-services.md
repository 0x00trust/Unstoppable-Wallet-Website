# What are popular DeFi services?

A number of DeFi services emerged over the last few years. While majority of them operate on top of Ethereum blockchain there are also services using other blockchains like Solana or Binance Smart Chain.

These include:

- crypto exchange services like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) or [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) enabling users to exchange one crypto token to another.
- crypto lending/borrowing services like [Aave](https://aave.com/), allowing users to lend or borrow cryptocurrency for a fee.
- other cryptocurrency powered financial services and products i.e. insurance, derivatives, stablecoin issuers and so on.
