# What are risks when using WalletConnect?

It should be noted that WalletConnect merely acts as a bridge between the DeFi service website and user's wallet (ex Unstoppable).

When user initiates any action on DeFi service website requiring transfer of funds Unstoppable wallet presents a user with the confirmation window to approve/deny the respective transaction. The Unstoppable wallet has little means to know the context of the transaction and merely acts as an instrument to allow/deny the transaction.

It's important to use a DeFi website provided by reliable entities. If a bad actor overtakes the website of the service it's potentially possible for a user to be presented with a confirmation window going beyond intents of the user without realising it. Therefore, only use well-regarded and widely used DeFi services.
